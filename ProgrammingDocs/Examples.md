# Cicada-16 Assembly Examples

This document provides a few short, well-commented programs to demonstrate basic programming concepts in Cicada-16 assembly.

### Example 1: Hello, World!

This program prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console using a hypothetical system call. It shows how to define data and loop through it.

```asm
.org 0x100
.define MSG_LEN 13

start:
    LDI R1, message     ; Load the address of the message into R1
    LDI R2, MSG_LEN     ; Load the length of the message into R2

print_loop:
    LD.b R3, (R1)+      ; Load a character from the message, post-increment address

    ; Hypothetical SYSCALL 0x01: Print the character in the lower byte of R3
    SYSCALL 0x01

    DEC R2              ; Decrement the length counter
    JRcc NZ, print_loop ; If not zero, loop to print the next character

end_loop:
    HALT                ; Halt the CPU

; --- Data ---
message:
    .byte 0x48, 0x65, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x6F, 0x2C, 0x20, 0x57, 0x6F, 0x72, 0x6C, 0x64, 0x21 ; "Hello, World!"
```

### Example 2: Sum of an Array

This program calculates the sum of a small array of 16-bit numbers. It demonstrates indexed addressing and looping.

```asm
.org 0x100

start:
    LDI R1, 0           ; R1 will be our loop counter (i)
    LDI R2, 0           ; R2 will hold the sum
    LDI R3, 5           ; R3 holds the number of elements to sum
    LDI R4, data_array  ; R4 holds the base address of the array

sum_loop:
    ; We can't do LD R0, (R4, R1) directly, so we calculate the address
    LD R0, R4           ; Copy base address to R0
    ADD R0, R1          ; Add index to get element address (R0 = R4 + R1)
    ADD R2, (R0)        ; Add the value from memory (at address in R0) to the sum in R2

    ADD R1, 2           ; Increment index by 2 (since each element is a 16-bit word)
    DEC R3              ; Decrement loop counter
    JRcc NZ, sum_loop   ; Loop if there are still elements left

end_loop:
    ; The sum is now in R2
    HALT

; --- Data ---
data_array:
    .word 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
```

### Example 3: Simple Subroutine

This example shows how to define and use a simple subroutine with `CALL` and `RET`. The subroutine multiplies `R0` by 2.

```asm
.org 0x100

start:
    LDI R0, 12          ; Load a value into the accumulator
    CALL multiply_by_two  ; Call the subroutine

    ; After returning, R0 will hold the value 24

    LDI R0, 5
    CALL multiply_by_two

    ; After returning, R0 will hold the value 10

    HALT

; --- Subroutine: multiply_by_two ---
; Multiplies the value in R0 by 2.
; Input: R0
; Output: R0
multiply_by_two:
    SHL R0              ; Logical shift left is equivalent to multiplying by 2
    RET                 ; Return to the caller
```

### Example 4: Project Structure with Includes

As projects grow, keeping all the code in a single file becomes unmanageable. The `.include` directive is essential for organizing a large project. A common and powerful pattern is to use a "master" assembly file as the entry point, which does little more than include all the other pieces of the project in the correct order.

This approach allows you to separate constants, variables, and different logical blocks of code into their own files.

#### Project File Structure

Imagine your project is laid out like this:

```
/my_game
|-- main.asm          (Master entry point)
|-- constants.asm     (Game-wide constants)
|-- memory.asm        (RAM variable definitions)
`-- logic/
    |-- player.asm    (Player control logic)
    `-- graphics.asm  (Graphics subroutines)
```

#### File Contents

Here's what each file might look like.

**`constants.asm`**
```asm
; This file contains all global constants.

.define SCREEN_WIDTH 320
.define SCREEN_HEIGHT 240
.define PLAYER_SPEED 2
```

**`memory.asm`**
```asm
; This file defines the layout of variables in RAM.
.org 0x8000 ; Start of RAM

player_x: .word 0
player_y: .word 0
score:    .word 0
```

**`logic/graphics.asm`**
```asm
; Graphics-related subroutines.

draw_player:
    ; Code to draw the player at (player_x, player_y)
    ; ...
    RET
```

**`logic/player.asm`**
```asm
; Player-related logic.

update_player_position:
    ; Code to read controller input and update player_x/player_y
    ; ...
    RET
```

**`main.asm` (The Master Include File)**
```asm
; Master entry point for the entire project.
; This file defines the overall structure and memory layout by including
; all other components in the correct order.

; --- Bank 0: Kernel and Main Logic ---
.bank 0
.org 0x100

; First, include all constants so they are available everywhere.
.include "constants.asm"

; Next, define the memory layout by including the variables file.
; This doesn't generate code here, but it's good practice to have it
; early so the assembler knows about the variable labels.
.include "memory.asm"

; The actual entry point of the program.
start:
    ; Initialization code...
    CALL init_graphics
    
main_loop:
    CALL update_player_position
    CALL draw_player
    JMP main_loop

; --- Bank 1: Subroutines ---
.bank 1
.org 0x4000 ; Start of Bank 1

; Include all our code subroutines here.
.include "logic/graphics.asm"
.include "logic/player.asm"

init_graphics:
    ; Code to set up the screen
    ; ...
    RET
```

This structure makes the code much easier to navigate and maintain. The `main.asm` file gives a high-level overview of the entire program's composition.
